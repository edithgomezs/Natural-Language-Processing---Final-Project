# Natural-Language-Processing-Final-Project

Topic: Yelp Restaurant Reviews: Analyzing and Predicting the Funny, Cool and Useful Review Scores

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset?select=yelp_academic_dataset_business.json

The focus of this project is to analyze, understand and predict the useful, cool, and funny review scores present on each restaurant review of the Yelp Dataset. 
To tackle this problem, we propose the following tasks:

1.	Predict the most popular sentiment of a review (multiclass classification)
2.	Predict whether a review hits thresholds for sentiments (binary classification)
3.	Predict the numerical scores for Useful, Funny, and Cool (regression)

Each one of these problems will provide a better understanding of how the users of Yelp qualify other userâ€™s reviews. 
Our approaches will be based on just natural language processing, with the objective of seeing if we would be able to replicate the scores based on text reviews.

For each task there is a sepparate notebook that runs on the same dataset.
For Task 1 the input file is a csv sample of the original dataset.
